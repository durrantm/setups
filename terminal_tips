My tools and preferences.  Not recommendations, best practices, work for everyone, etc.

3 Main areas to cover:

1) A (compact) .bashrc that works on both Ubuntu and OSX including a new machine. on github dotfiles.

2) .bash_aliases that I like.  Focus on 1 letter ones.  4 term windows.  d, n, p, g, c, b, h, l, z!!!ipcar, q (deep nest)

3) .bashrc
  - ls in color
  - git
  - PS1 prompt, including git branch, \n ath the end a/b/c/_x/y/z
  - git autocomplete
  - instant dotfiles update (bup)
  - autocd
  - autojump
  - set -o vi
